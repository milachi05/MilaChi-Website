        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mila Chi. I am an eighteen year old first year college student at the University of California- Riverside. I am currently majoring in Sociology and hope to graduate with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree. With this degree, I plan to attend a prestigious law school to further my education. My hopes are that one day I can be the Attorney General of the United States and serve my country in this way. Ever since I was young, I have always loved helping others and became highly upset when people did not get the justice they deserved. Growing up, my family faced a lot of injustice and it further pushed me to want to pursue a career in law. This motivation I have within me is all attributed to my family. They have stood with me through mistakes and amazing achievements. I owe a great deal to them. 
<br><br>

        I am the youngest child in a family of four. Ever since I was young, my family and I have gone on road trips to Northern California or vacations back to our home country of Taiwan. I greatly look forward to these yearly family bonding time because I believe that having a strong bond with your family is important to one's mental health. With having such a supportive family motivating me, they have inspired me to do bigger and better things. I hope one day in the future I will be able to repay my parents for everything they have done for me. 
<br><br>
        
        Not only am I a full time student, I also balance a part time job at the same time. I currently work at a sandwich shop called Jimmy Johns. As this franchise is not as popular here in the east as it is in the midwest, it is basically a sandwich shop that makes sandwiches ‚Äúfreaky fast‚Äù. I have had this job ever since I was a senior in college. It has almost been one and a half years! With this job, I have learned many lifelong lessons. For example, I realized the struggle of working a minimum wage job and how money is hard to earn. Since I held a job at a time in which most of my friends did not, it was a great way for me to learn how to manage time.
<br><br>
        
        When I am not in class or at work, I am Director of Public Relations in my sorority Alpha Delta Pi. Within my sorority I am not only an active member but I also handle all things that deal with Public Relations. This includes, but is not limited to, updating and maintaining the our various social media platforms and upcoming recruitment plans. As it is my first year being in a sorority, I love my new position because it allows me to experience various perspectives of being in a sorority. With this position, it has taught me patience and how to accept respectful criticism. With any position held in a sorority, it can cause much stress on oneself. It is amazing having a wonderful group of girls that have my back and will support me through my endeavors.
